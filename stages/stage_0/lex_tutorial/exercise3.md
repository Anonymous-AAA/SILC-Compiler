# Exercise 3

What would be the outputs of the lexical analyzer generated by the example LEX programs under section 3.2 and 4.1 for the following input :

```
25
32
44
```

Would both the outputs be the same? If not, explain why.

Answer: The outputs would be different as in 4.1 the execution ends after the first the first lexeme (25) is found as it is returned, but in 3.2 all numbers get passed through the lexer.
