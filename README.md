# SILC-Compiler

My implementation of project EXPL (Experimental Language) as part of my Complier Design Laboratory course.

Most of the stages contain a notes.md file which contain the important points, errors I made etc.

More info: https://silcnitc.github.io/expl-docs/

Add scripts folder to path. 

Use library from stage 6.
